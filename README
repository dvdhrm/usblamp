= Warning =

This driver uses an obsolete protocol. Newer linux-kernel releases contain an
in-kernel driver for this USB-Lamp so this userspace driver is no longer needed.

Please see:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob;f=drivers/usb/misc/usbled.c;hb=HEAD

This software package is no longer under development and no bugs are fixed.
Please use the in-kernel driver.

= Dreamcheeky USB-Lamp Driver =
  Userland driver for dreamcheeky usb lamp. This driver allows to
  control the Dreamcheeky USB-Lamp via userspace on the command line. This
  application takes as argument an RGB value and sets a specific or all
  connected usblamps to this color.
  Run the application without arguments to get usage information.

  This application depens on "libusb". This library is available for different
  platforms, including linux and Windows.
  The shipped makefile is for UNIX systems. Windows users should compile this
  program by hand. This shouldn't be too hard. Read the makefile carefully.

= Install =
  compilation: make
  clean: make clean
  install: make install (this installs with SETUID bit into /usr/bin)
  uninstall: make uninstall (this removes /usr/bin/usblamp)

= License =
  This program and the related documentation is dedicated to the Public Domain.

  This driver is written from scratch, however, reverse engineering
  was previously also done by Daniel Kaefer:
    http://github.com/daniel-git/usblamp
  This driver uses an improved protocol over the one from Daniel Kaefer. This code
  does not contain any code or information from the implementation of Daniel Kaefer,
  however, the protocol information hints from Daniel Kaefer helped developing this
  driver. Thanks!
  The idea of this driver was inspired by the one from Daniel Kaefer, however, this
  driver uses a plain C interface instead of C++ and does not use any deprecated
  libusb-0.1 dependencies.
  Use it at your own risk.

= Library =
  The driver.h and driver.c files implement a clean driver API for the usblamp. You
  may use these files to access the usblamps in your own application. However, it is
  recommended to compile the main.c application and use the command line interface to
  access the usblamps.
